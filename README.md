#Android Nanodegree SuperDuo
Project 3 of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. Individual application repositories can be found at links provided.

##Android Nanodegree Alexandria App - (https://github.com/grimesmea/android-nd-alexandria)
This application gets book information from a Google API. All titles, cover images, and author information come from there. The original version of this app was built by Sascha Jaschke, and a modified version was given to students in the Udacity Android Nanodegree program.

##Android Nanodegree Football Scores App - (https://github.com/grimesmea/android-nd-football-scores)
This application gets football match scores from football-data.org for various leagues. The original version of this app was created by Yahia Khalid Ibn El Walid Ahmed, and a modified version was given to students in the Udacity Android Nanodegree program.

This product uses the football-data.org API but is not endorsed or certified by football-data.org.

###football-data.org API Key
In order for the app to query the football-data.org API, a personal API key will need to be obtained by creating a football-data.org account (http://api.football-data.org/register) and requesting an API key.

Once obtained, the following line will need to be added to the local.properties file for project:

```
FOOT_BALL_DATA_API_TOKEN=[YOUR API KEY HERE]
```
